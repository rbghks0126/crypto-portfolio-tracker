Various metrics for the 70 tokens that I am interested in such as:
- price, market cap, market cap rank, all time high price, no. of days since ath, percentage change from ath, recent 24h low, percentage change from recent 24h low, etc.

On a separate sheet are some basic visualizations of my portfolio and market conditions.
