# crypto-realtime-tracker

This is a real-time (if you click update) Crypto market / portfolio tracker that I built for my personal investment in cryptocurrencies.

## Features
By clicking the 'UPDATE' button, various real-time metrics for the 70 tokens that I am interested in are fetched and visualized.
These include:
- price, market cap, market cap rank, all time high price, no. of days since ath, percentage change from ath, recent 24h low, percentage change from recent 24h low, etc.
The point is to identify easily coins that have shot up or coins that still seem to be undervalued. It is also easy to see which sectors/categories I am over/underexposed to. 

On a separate sheet are some basic visualizations of my portfolio and market conditions.

## Examples

There aren't that many features/visualizations implemented but hopefully there are more to come!
